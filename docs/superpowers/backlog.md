# Pensieve — Backlog (deferred, not forgotten)

Ideas we've deliberately parked so a phase stays focused. Each is on the roadmap;
none is foreclosed. Revisit when the noted trigger arrives.

## Phase 1B-org: the typed tree & strands — DONE (2026-07-04)

**Shipped** on branch `phase-1b-org` (plan: `plans/2026-07-04-pensieve-phase1b-org.md`, spec:
`specs/2026-07-03-pensieve-phase1b-org-design.md`). 75 tests, subagent-driven with a per-task
review gate + an opus whole-branch review. Delivered: the `Project→Node` rename + strict
recursive typed tree; git-common-dir source keying (worktree unification); conservative
tag-then-materialize strand birth (≥2 same-kind events) with lossless repoint of events **and**
their loose ends; `SessionStart` hook + `SessionBranch`; on-device strand naming; `group()`
child re-parenting; organizing CLI + tree `list`. Additive migrations v4–v6; trust gate untouched.

### Deferred out of 1B-org (on the roadmap, not foreclosed)

- **Domain-level recursive rollup** summaries (CTE over descendants) so `status <domain>` shows
  loose ends sitting in child strands. *Trigger: when the tree is deep enough to want rollups.*
- **Per-kind ingestion-handler protocol** (fingerprint/enrich/extract) — a `switch` suffices for
  git+session. *Trigger: a 4th source type.*
- **Cross-cutting soft references** (`node_links`, cycles allowed).
- **Evidence-based loose-end auto-close** (1B/1B-org only surface + age; never auto-close).
- **`SessionEnd` auto-ingest wiring** — session *content* ingestion still runs via
  `pensieve ingest-session --path`; auto-triggering it from a hook is deferred.
- **Retroactive worktree-merge / source re-keying in migration** — v4–v6 do NOT re-key
  pre-1B-org sources to common-dir; a pre-existing repo forks into a new node on its next
  post-upgrade ingest (lossless, fixable with `group()`). Accepted per spec §8.

### Small follow-ups from the 1B-org whole-branch review (deferred, non-blocking)

- **`nest` / `add --parent` cycle guard** — no check prevents nesting a node under its own
  descendant; a resulting cycle becomes an island `list` silently drops (no infinite loop).
  Add a walk-to-root guard. *Protects the `list` view, the tool's main surface.*
- **`NodeCommands.find` name-collision handling** — name-addressed CLI resolves an arbitrary
  row when two nodes share a name (plausible: two `auth` strands). UUID is the preferred path;
  add an "ambiguous name" guard or note it in help text.
- **`SettingsHookInstaller` presence check** is a substring `.contains("capture-session-start")`
  (low risk; our own command string).
- **`SessionBranch` has no retention/GC** — one row per session forever (fine at single-user scale).
- **True v3→v4 upgrade test** — `SchemaV4Tests` exercises the head schema but not a seeded
  pre-v4 `projects` row migrated through v4 (GRDB migrator exposes no `upTo:` seam via
  `openCanonicalDatabase`; migration SQL is simple + additive).

### From the 2026-07-04 real-data validation run

- **Strand naming echoes the newest commit** — on-device naming tends to reuse the most recent
  commit's subject as the strand name rather than synthesizing across the branch's activity
  (real run: a `feat/compose-swarm-reconciliation` strand got named *"Improved code formatting"*
  after its newest commit). Best-effort metadata, **outside the trust gate by design**, and
  fixable with `rename`. *Revisit if strand labels feel consistently off; the naming prompt could
  weight the branchKey and the span of commits, not just the latest summary.* The description was
  correctly grounded — only the short name is weak.
- **(FIXED 2026-07-04) Fractional-second timestamps** — `TranscriptParser` used a default
  `ISO8601DateFormatter`, which rejects Claude Code's `…:43.382Z` timestamps, leaving
  `startedAt`/`endedAt` nil so every session event was stamped at ingest time and dormancy read
  `0d`. Fixed (fractional-then-plain fallback) + regression test `parsesFractionalSecondTimestamps`.

## Pensieve.app v0.1: the heartbeat window — DONE (2026-07-04)

**Shipped** on branch `feat/pensieve-app-heartbeat` (plan: `plans/2026-07-04-pensieve-app-heartbeat.md`, spec:
`specs/2026-07-04-pensieve-app-heartbeat-design.md`). 82 tests. Delivered: native read-only SwiftUI
heartbeat window (`swift run PensieveApp`) over a shared, testable `MonitorSnapshot` kernel (pure gather
function, never throws, read-only, WAL-safe). Window shows status dot (active/idle/not-set-up), last-capture
age, spool/event/loose-end counts, polls every 3 s. Unbundled SwiftPM executable (no Xcode, no `.app`
bundle yet).

### Deferred out of v0.1 (on the roadmap, not foreclosed)

- **Menu-bar item / `LSUIElement` app bundle** — the heartbeat window currently runs as an unbundled
  SwiftPM executable (dock icon, focus behavior still to be confirmed). Next phase wraps it in a proper
  `.app` bundle and adds a menu-bar item with `LSUIElement` to hide the dock icon. Own spec required; 
  revisit the Xcode.app decision there (Command Line Tools suffice for now; Xcode.app may be needed 
  for code signing, menu-bar item setup, or `.app` bundle best practices).

### Small follow-ups from v0.1 (deferred, non-blocking)

- **`lastCaptureAt` has no staleness cap** — a node with an ancient capture and 0 events currently reads
  `idle` not `not-set-up` (incorrect signal). Add a staleness check: if `lastCaptureAt` is older than a
  configured threshold (e.g. 30 days), and `eventCount == 0`, treat as `notSetUp`. *Fixes the edge case
  where a dormant project looks "idle" rather than "never started."*
- **Unbundled window visual behavior** — dock icon presence, focus/activation behavior, and close-on-⌘W
  exit behavior of the unbundled `NSApplication` are still to be confirmed at the menu-bar step (Step 1 
  verified a window appears, but in-situ behavior may differ once menu-bar integration is added).

## Spike: statistical theme discovery across strands (`NLEmbedding`)

**Parked:** 2026-07-03, during Phase 1B brainstorming.
**Revisit when:** the grounded loose-end/summary layer (1B) is proven and we want the
"broad picture of how strands unfold across the whole tree" — i.e. surfacing
*recurring cross-cutting themes* ("you keep touching auth across three projects")
rather than per-project state.

**Idea:** use unsupervised statistical analysis (word2vec-style embeddings +
clustering) over captured session/commit text and extracted loose ends to surface
recurring themes and candidate cross-cutting strands/concepts automatically.

**Constraints & the native path:**
- **No Python, ever.** The Swift-native route is Apple's `NLEmbedding` (the
  `NaturalLanguage` framework) for on-device word/sentence embeddings — no API key,
  no external service, runs locally. This is the intended implementation surface.
- **Grounding caveat (important).** Opaque embedding clusters are hard to *cite*,
  which cuts against Pensieve's provenance-or-it-doesn't-exist north star. When we
  build this, prefer using embeddings as a *retrieval/grouping aid* that feeds a
  grounded LLM synthesis (which can cite real captured text), rather than surfacing
  raw clusters as if they were findings. Themes must still trace to captured text.

**Why it's a perfect Pensieve dogfood case:** this note is itself a `concept`/`topic`
— a targeted exploration parked for later. When Pensieve can track a strand like this
(let me forget it for a month, then reload full context and continue), it's working.
